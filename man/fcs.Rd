\title{Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy}
\usage{
fcs(x , y = NULL, nPoints = 25000, pcf = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of length N.}

\item{y}{Numeric vector of length N.}

\item{nPoints}{The size of the sub-vectors in which the input vectors will be divided. This number must be less than N/2.}

\item{pcf}{A boolean parameter to determine if an alternate version of the correlation function is used for the calculation of de pCF and pComb functions.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector G containing either the autocorrelation for the input vector x, or the cross-correlation between x and y vectors, with a length of nPoints.
}
\description{
Performs either the auto-correlation, or cross-correlation between vectors x and y, returning a correlation function.
}
\details{
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a technique with high spatial and temporal resolution used to analyze the kinetics of particles diffusing at low concentrations. The detected fluorescence intensity as a function of time is: F(t).

The correlation function is computed as the normalized autocorrelation function, G(tau) = <deltaF(t)deltaF(t+tau)>/(<F(t)>*<F(t)>), to the collected data set, where t refers to a time point of flourescence acquisition, and tau refers to the temporal delay between acquisitions and <...> indicates average. 

The correlation between deltaF(t) = F(t) - <F(t)> and deltaF(t+tau) = F(t+tau) - <F(t)> is calculated for a range of delay times.
For temporal acquisitions as FCS point, x takes the value of F(t) and y = NULL.
For cross-correlation experiments between two fluorescent signals x = F1(t) and y = F2(t), as channels, the correlation function is: G(tau) = <deltaF1(t) deltaF2(t+tau)> / (<F1(t)> <F2(t)>).

The function separate the original vector in sub-vectors of same length (n-points), then calculate an autocorrelation function form each sub-vector. The final result will be an average of all the autocorrelation functions.
}
\note{
The argument nPoints must be smaller than the total number of temporal observations N, it is recommended to set nPoints = 2^n, with n = {2, ..., infinity}.

\examples{
## Choose between these two Data Sets: Cy5_1nM, Cy5_10nM.
## These data sets are simulations of the molecular diffusion Cy5 in two distinct concentrations.

##Here is the execution of the FCS method for the Cy5_1nM Data set
g <- fcs(x = Cy5_1nM$f)
len <- 1:length(g)
oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(y = g, x = Cy5_1nM$t[len], log = 'x', type = 'l',
xlab = expression(tau(mu~s)), ylab = expression(G(tau)), main = "Cy5 in 1nM")
par(oldpar)
