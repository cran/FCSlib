\title{General Correlation Function}
\usage{
gcf(x, y, xmean = 1, ymean = 1, c = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numerical signal with dimensions M x N x Z.}

\item{y}{A numerical signal with dimensions M x N x Z.}

\item{xmean}{The mean value of the signal x.}

\item{ymean}{The mean value of the signal y.}

\item{c}{A numeric variable to restrict the correlation to positives values.}
}
\value{
G   A numerical signal with dimension N' x M' x Z'
}
\description{
Performs either the auto-correlation or cross-correlation between vectors x and y, returning a correlation function.
}
\details{
The number of emission events per unit time is determined and used to generate autocorrelation and cross-correlation curves from the intensity traces F(t) and the fluctuations deltaF(t) = F(t)-<F(t)>.
The auto-correlation function of the collected data set, is computed as the normalized auto-correlation function, when y=x. The general auto-correlation function is defined as:
G(tau) = (deltaF(t) deltaF(t+tau) )/(<F(t)> <F(t)>),
where t refers to a time point of fluorescence acquisition, and tau refers to the temporal delay between acquisitions. <...> is the temporal average of F(t); and deltaF(t) = F(t)-<F(t)>, deltaF(t+tau) = F(t+tau)-<F(t)>.

For temporal acquisitions such as point FCS, x and y are F(t).
The cross-correlation function between two channels of fluorescent signals, x = F1(t) and y = F2(t), the cross-correlation function is defined as:
G(tau) = (deltaF1(t) deltaF2(t+tau) )/(<F1(t)><F2(t)>),
where xmean = <F1(t)> and ymean = <F2(t)> are the mean values of the fluorescent signals.
