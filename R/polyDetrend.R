#' @title Polynomial detrending of a time series
#' 
#' @description Performs the polynomial detrending algorithm over a vector
#' @aliases polyDetrend
#' @usage polyDetrend(f, acqTime, nIntervals, degree = 3, plot = TRUE)
#' @param f A vector
#' @param acqTime Point acquisition rate (in seconds)
#' @param nIntervals Number of intervals into which the vector will be grouped before a polynomial model fit 
#' @param degree The degree of the polynomial function
#' @param plot Boolean, set to TRUE (default) to plot the result
#' @details First, the binTimeSeries() function is used to obtain a binned version of 'f' of 'nIntervals' points.
#' A polynomial model of user-specified degree is then adjusted to the binned vector. The full time series is then
#' evaluated using the obtained model and the residuals are calculated. Finally, the maximum value of the fitted time
#' series is added to the residuals for trend correction.
