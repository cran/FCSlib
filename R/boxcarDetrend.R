#' @title Boxcar filter detrending of a time series
#' 
#' @description Performs the boxcar filter detrending algorithm over a vector
#' @aliases boxcarDetrend
#' @usage boxcarDetrend(f, w, acqTime, nIntervals, plot = TRUE)
#' @param f A vector
#' @param w Size of the time window of the moving average
#' @param acqTime Point acquisition rate (in seconds).
#' @param nIntervals Number of intervals into which the moving average vector will be grouped.
#' @param plot Boolean, set to TRUE (default) to plot the result
#' @details First, an amount of zeroes equal to (w-1) is added at the tail of 'f' to compensate for the moving average
#' effect when position (length(f) - w + 1) is reached. The moving average is then calculated and subtracted from the
#' original vector 'f' to obtain the residuals. The moving average vector is then binned and the first value of the
#' resulting vector is used as the lambda parameter for a Poisson distribution from which integer numbers will be
#' randomly sampled and added to the residuals vector for trend correction.
